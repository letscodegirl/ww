        bio: Founder of RAMP
        description: |
            <p>I'm Erick Mendoza, originally from San Francisco, California, USA.</p>
            
            <p>With over <strong>25 years</strong> of combined professional and academic experience, I bring a unique blend of sales expertise, cross-cultural communication, and training knowledge:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><strong>15 years</strong> as a trainer and educator specializing in Sales, Negotiation, and Business Presentation Skills.</li>
            <li><strong>10 years</strong> of hands-on business sales and management experience in the competitive San Francisco Bay Area market.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Academic Background:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Master's degree in Management (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign)</li>
            <li>Master's degree in Counseling</li>
            <li>Bachelor's degree in Psychology</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This blend of real-world sales experience and academic expertise allows me to design training that isn't theoretical, it's practical, tested, and designed to get results. The RAMP approach helps hotel teams master the art of guest interaction, turning everyday conversations into opportunities for increased revenue and lasting loyalty. My 10 years in San Francisco taught me high-stakes persuasion. My 16 years in Asia taught me nuanced communication. Now, I combine both to help Southeast Asia's hospitality industry excel.</p>

        <p><em><strong>RAMP’s mission is to&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>train and empower hospitality teams to master guest interactions, building lasting loyalty that drives revenue, reputation, and growth.</strong></p>
        <p><em><strong>RAMP was founded to bridge the gap for hotels and resorts who want to deliver world-class service but struggle with inconsistent staff training. </strong></em></p>
        <p><em><strong> We believe every guest interaction, from check-in to check-out is an opportunity to build loyalty. RAMP equips hotel/resort teams with the confidence and skills to understand guest needs, resolve conflicts, and create memorable experiences that drive repeat business. </strong></em></p>
        <p><em><strong> By tailoring training to your specific property and goals, RAMP helps you increase guest spending, improve online reviews, and build a service culture that sets you apart.</strong></em></p>
