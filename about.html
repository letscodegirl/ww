                <p style="font-size: 18px;">I’m Erick Mendoza, originally from San Francisco, California, USA.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 18px;">With over <strong>25 years</strong> of combined professional and academic experience, I bring a unique blend of sales expertise, cross-cultural communication, and training knowledge:</p>

                <ul>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong> - 15 years</strong> as a trainer and educator specializing in Sales, Negotiation, and Business Presentation Skills.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong> - 10 years</strong> of hands-on business sales and management experience in the competitive San Francisco Bay Area market.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                        <strong>Academic Background:</strong><br>
                        - Master’s degree in Management (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign).<br>
                        - Master’s degree in Counseling.<br>
                        - Bachelor’s degree in Psychology.
                    </p>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">This blend of real-world business experience and academic expertise allows me to design and deliver training that isn’t theoretical—it’s practical, tested, and designed to get results. My approach ensures startups and SMEs can sharpen their sales processes, master persuasive presentations, and win the confidence of investors and clients in global markets.</p>

        <p><em><strong>RAMP’s mission is to give startups and SMEs the tools to close deals, secure investment, and thrive in international markets.</strong></em></p>
