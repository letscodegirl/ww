                <p style="font-size: 18px;">I’m Erick Mendoza, originally from San Francisco, California, USA.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 18px;">With over <strong>25 years</strong> of combined professional and academic experience, I bring a unique blend of sales expertise, cross-cultural communication, and training knowledge:</p>

                <ul>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong> - 15 years</strong> as a trainer and educator specializing in Sales, Negotiation, and Business Presentation Skills.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong> - 10 years</strong> of hands-on business sales and management experience in the competitive San Francisco Bay Area market.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                        <strong>Academic Background:</strong><br>
                        - Master’s degree in Management (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign).<br>
                        - Master’s degree in Counseling.<br>
                        - Bachelor’s degree in Psychology.
                    </p>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">This blend of real-world business experience and academic expertise allows me to design and deliver training that isn’t theoretical—it’s practical, tested, and designed to get results. My approach ensures startups and SMEs can sharpen their sales processes, master persuasive presentations, and win the confidence of investors and clients in global markets.</p>

        <p><em><strong>RAMP’s mission is to&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>train and empower hospitality teams to master guest interactions, building lasting loyalty that drives revenue, reputation, and growth.</strong></p>
        <p><em><strong>RAMP was founded to bridge the gap for hotels and resorts who want to deliver world-class service but struggle with inconsistent staff training. </strong></em></p>

RAMP equips hotel/resort teams with the confidence and skills to understand guest needs, resolve conflicts, and create memorable experiences that drive repeat business. </strong></em></p>
        <p><em><strong> By tailoring training to your specific property and goals, RAMP helps you increase guest spending, improve online reviews, and build a service culture that sets you apart.</strong></em></p>
