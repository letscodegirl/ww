# "Decoding Sales Excellence" (An Opinion Piece)

What does it take to be a great salesperson? Traditional characteristics like charisma, an extroverted personality, and the ability to close deals have long been declared qualities belonging to great salespeople. From my ten years of sales experience, I would agree that these are all good traits to have. However, I would declare that they are not as essential as the following:

## 1\. Persistence:






## 2\. Collaborating Inside and Out:

Successful sales professionals must nurture collaboration not only within their organizations but also across diverse decision-making groups in client companies.

## 3\. Leveraging Digital and Virtual Channels:

In an increasingly digital world, proficiency in utilizing digital tools for customer engagement is paramount. Pfizer's requirement for sales reps to proficiently use digital platforms underscores the importance of integrating technology into sales strategies.

## 4\. Ability to Get Power from Data:

Salespeople need to harness the power of data analytics to drive informed decision-making and enhance customer interactions.

## 5\. Capacity to Adapt:

Sales professionals must demonstrate agility in adapting to evolving market dynamics and changing customer preferences. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of not only hiring individuals with these competencies but also fostering their development through on-the-job training and support.
